🛠️ What You Need

✅ If You Purchased a Preassembled Pedro:

1x Pedro Robot (Rev3) with a 7.4V DC Battery

Built-in modules: NRF24L01, ESP8266-01, Bluetooth HC-05, OLED 128x64

A PC with Arduino IDE installed


🔨 If You’re Building Pedro Yourself:

📌 3D-printed parts (available on GitHub)

🔌 Pedro Rev3 PCB (Gerber files available on GitHub)

⚙️ Servo motors (MG90S or compatible)

📡 Electronic modules (NRF24L01, ESP8266-01, Bluetooth HC-05, OLED 128x64)

🔋 7.4V DC battery & charger

💻 A PC with Arduino IDE installed

⚙️ 1. Assembling Pedro

(If you have a preassembled Pedro, skip to Step 2)

1️⃣ 3D print the parts (STL files available on GitHub)
2️⃣ Assemble the components (no screws, no glue—just plug & play 🛠️)
3️⃣ Attach the servo motors and connect them to the Pedro board
4️⃣ Install the modules (NRF, ESP8266, Bluetooth, OLED)
5️⃣ Plug in the battery and power on Pedro!

💻 2. Programming & Configuration

1️⃣ Install Required Software

Download Arduino IDE

Install the required libraries: Servo, Wire, Adafruit GFX, Adafruit SSD1306


2️⃣ Flash the Bootloader (If You Built Pedro Yourself)

If you built your own PCB, it doesn’t have the correct bootloader yet. To make Pedro work with Arduino, you first need to flash the Arduino Pro Micro bootloader via the SPI pins.

📌 How to do it?

1. Connect an Arduino Uno or an ISP programmer to Pedro’s SPI pins


2. Upload the "Arduino as ISP" sketch to your Arduino Uno


3. Select Arduino Pro Micro (ATmega32U4) as the target board


4. Go to Tools > Burn Bootloader



🎯 Once done, disconnect the SPI wiring, plug Pedro into your PC via micro USB, open Arduino IDE, and check in "Tools > Port" to ensure the board is recognized.

3️⃣ Flash Pedro’s Firmware

Download Pedro’s firmware from GitHub

Open Arduino IDE, select Arduino Pro Micro

Upload the firmware and test the movements 🎮

🎮 3. Control Modes

Pedro can be controlled in three different ways:

📡 WiFi (ESP8266-01) – Control Pedro via a web or mobile app
🎮 Bluetooth (HC-05) – Use an Android/iOS app
📻 Radio (NRF24L01) – Connect Pedro to another microcontroller

📌 Examples and code available on GitHub
